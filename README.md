## 🚀 About Me

I’m a passionate developer who loves creating things that blend **technology, creativity, and impact** — from interactive games and cloud-based apps to AI-powered prototypes.  
I’m always exploring how software can improve people’s experiences — whether through smarter data systems, intuitive UI design, or automation.

During my time at **Nike HQ**, I contributed to projects involving **AWS Glue, DynamoDB, and AI Agentic Systems** under the MCP (Machine-Learning Compute Platform) team.  
At **KSU**, I’ve taken on leadership and technical roles through the **Kennesaw Society of Black Computing Professionals (KSBCP)**, hosting Python workshops and building community through tech events.

I believe in continuous learning, collaboration, and building things that make an impact.
