## 🧭 About Me

I’m a **Software Engineer and Computer Science student** passionate about building intelligent, scalable, and data-driven systems.  
My journey combines hands-on software engineering experience with curiosity about AI, data automation, and cloud computing.  

I’ve had the privilege of interning with **Nike** and **State Farm**, where I developed production-level tools and automation systems leveraging **AWS, Databricks, LangChain, and Generative AI**. I also lead as **President of the Kennesaw Society of Black Computing Professionals (KSBCP)** — building community and opportunities for underrepresented computing students.  

I love exploring the intersection of **AI + Software Engineering**, and I’m driven by creating projects that make development faster, smarter, and more impactful.
